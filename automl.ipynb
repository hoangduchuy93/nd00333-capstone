Hence, if the user doesn't provide an explicit validation dataset, a part of the training dataset is used to achieve this. For smaller datasets (fewer than 20,000 samples), cross-validation is leveraged, else a single hold-out set is split from the training data to serve as the validation dataset. Hence, for your input data we leverage cross-validation with 10 folds, if the number of training samples are fewer than 1000, and 3 folds in all other cases.\n              Learn more about cross validation: https://aka.ms/AutomatedMLCrossValidation\nDETAILS:      \n+------------------------------+\n|Number of folds               |\n+==============================+\n|10                            |\n+------------------------------+\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nTYPE:         Class balancing detection\nSTATUS:       PASSED\nDESCRIPTION:  Your inputs were analyzed, and all classes are balanced in your training data.\n              Learn more about imbalanced data: https://aka.ms/AutomatedMLImbalancedData\n\n********************************************************************************************\n\nTYPE:         Missing feature values imputation\nSTATUS:       DONE\nDESCRIPTION:  If the missing values are expected, let the run complete.
