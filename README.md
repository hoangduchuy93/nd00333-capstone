# Capstone Project - Azure Machine Learning Engineer

This project is the classification problem using both hyperparameters HyperDrive and AutoML to get the best model and deploy the model. I will be using both hyperdrive and automl API from Azure to build this project. The datasetis about Titanic passenger survival possibility,where I get the data from Kaggle. The project involves the following step:
1. Choose a dataset (here is Titanic passenger survival possibility)
2. Import dataset into workspace
3. Train model using:
    - Automated ML
    - HyperDrive
4. Compare model the performance
5. Deploy the best model
6. Test model End point

## Dataset
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle with link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
In this problem, we are asked to build a classification model that answers the question: "what sorts of people were more likely to survive?" using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

### Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.
||Variable||	Definition||	Key||
survival	Survival	0 = No, 1 = Yes
pclass	Ticket class	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
sex	Sex	
Age	Age in years	
sibsp	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
parch	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
ticket	Ticket number	
fare	Passenger fare	
cabin	Cabin number	
embarked	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
